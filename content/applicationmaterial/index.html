          <p><strong>Dear Officer Selection Board,</strong></p>
          <section>
            <p>I am applying to commission into the United States Space Force because of my passion for service. As a Computer Science major with hands-on experience in embedded systems, CAD, and technical media production, I would be honored to apply my skills to one of our nation's most forward-thinking and technologically advanced military branches.</p>
            <p>To me, joining the Space Force is more than just an opportunity to be at the cutting edge of space technology—it's an opportunity to grow into a more disciplined, resilient, and impactful leader. This domain will challenge me to adapt, improvise, and overcome—something I must accustom myself to succeed. Being driven by self-improvement, I view the Space Force as a powerful environment for personal and professional growth while contributing to a mission greater than myself.</p>
            <p>Equally important is the chance to serve alongside people of service-minded character—individuals who lead with integrity, take pride in their mission, and embody the principle of service before self. I've long admired and enjoyed the company of service members, and that culture inspires me. I want to contribute to it and be shaped by it.</p>
            <p>In my technical and academic work, I consistently look beyond the task to consider its broader impact. I take initiative not for recognition but because I believe progress should be intentional, organized, and built to last. I bring structure to ambiguity and clarity to complexity—because I value foresight, accountability, and shared success. These are traits I intend to carry forward as a Guardian and officer.</p>
            <p>I feel greatly drawn to the Space Force's mission to secure and advance U.S. capabilities in the space domain. As space continues to grow in importance—supporting military operations and improving civilian life—I feel called to contribute. My values—service, excellence, and respect—align with the Space Force's culture of selflessness, innovation, and structure.</p>
            <p>It would be an honor to serve as a Guardian and officer, contributing meaningfully to the mission and excellence of the United States Space Force. Reach me at (407) 516-4785 or <span>david.coleworks@gmail.com</span>. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
          </section>
          <p>Sincerely,<br /><span>David A. Cole</span></p>
